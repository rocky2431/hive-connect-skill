# Hive Bridge

Use this skill when the user asks you to install Hive Bridge, connect a local agent to Hive, or keep a local agent online for Hive cloud chat and delegated work.

## Goal

Install the `hive-bridge` CLI, complete browser-based login, verify the user-scoped Local Agent Channel connection, and start the outbound WebSocket runner.

Login creates a long-lived binding. Do not ask the user to log in again just because the computer slept, restarted, or the runner disconnected; restart the runner instead.

## Install The CLI

Run:

```bash
npm install -g @hiveclaw243/hive-bridge
hive-bridge status
```

If `hive-bridge status` says it is not logged in, continue to login.

## Login

Run:

```bash
hive-bridge login
```

Open the activation URL, let the user log in to Hive, and ask the user to approve the Local Agent Link on the Hive Local Agent page.

Then verify:

```bash
hive-bridge status
```

## Keep The Local Agent Online

For cloud-to-local chat, file transfer, and delegated work, run:

```bash
hive-bridge run --transport websocket
```

This runner uses outbound HTTPS/WebSocket connections only. Do not expose a local port, reverse proxy, tunnel, or public callback server.

The foreground runner reconnects after transient WebSocket failures. Treat online/offline as runtime presence only; it is separate from the long-lived login binding.

## Upload A Local File To Hive

Run:

```bash
hive-bridge upload <path>
```

Report the uploaded workspace path back to the user.
